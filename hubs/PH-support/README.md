# PCCR support in proximity ligation experiments
Track Hub for PCCR supported by RNA-RNA contacts derived from RIC-seq

## How it works:
1. Copy the link [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smargasyuk/ucsc-hubs-misc/master/hubs/PH-support/hub.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smargasyuk/ucsc-hubs-misc/master/hubs/PH-support/hub.txt).
2. Go to UCSC Genome Browser: https://genome.ucsc.edu/
3. Open My Data -> Track Hubs
4. Select My Hubs 
5. Paste the link into the bar and press Add Hub 

Data is avaliable for:
- Human: hg38

## Tracks:

### RNA proximity ligation contacts supporting PCCRs:
RNA-RNA contacts supporting PCCRs. Contacts were derived from RIC-seq ([GSE190214](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE190214)), KARR-Seq ([GSE166155](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE166155)), and PARIS ([GSE149493](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149493)) data using RNAcontacts(https://github.com/smargasyuk/RNAcontacts) pipeline.

### PCCRs supported by proximity ligation experiments:
PCCRs supported by RNA-RNA contacts.
